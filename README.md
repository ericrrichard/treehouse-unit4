TreeHouse Unit 4 Project

Implemented the basic game along with a keyboard handler.  For custom CSS did the following:

- Created a border on the keyboard to make it look more like a keyboard
- Added drop shadow to the keys to give a 3D look
- Added an animation to the display of guessed letters
- Added an adnimation to fade out the start screen
- Dropped the hearts off the screen when you make an incorrect guess.
